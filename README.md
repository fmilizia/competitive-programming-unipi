# Competitive Programming and Contests
This year I am attending a class about algorithmic problems, called 
*Competitive Programming and Contests*.
The webpage of the class, mantained by the teacher,
can be found [here](https://github.com/rossanoventurini/CompetitiveProgramming).

I am collecting here all the solutions for the exercises given as homework
in the class.
