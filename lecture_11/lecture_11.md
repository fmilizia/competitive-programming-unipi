# Lecture 11 (21/10/2019)

## Nested segments
The problem can be found [here](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/652/D?locale=en)
and [this](code/nested_segments.cpp) is my code.

This problem already appeared in the last lecture, but this time it is solved using
a segment tree. The complexity is the same.
